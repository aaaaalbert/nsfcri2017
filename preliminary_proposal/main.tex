\subsection{Overview}
\explain{A concise description of the infrastructure to be developed, enhanced, or
sustained. This includes a description of major equipment needs for the 
project as well as other significant costs. Projects that involve 
enhancements to, or sustainment of, existing infrastructures should 
include information about the existing resources.}

The \acrfull{IoT} paradigm proposes networked embedded devices
for large-scale, distributed sensing, control, and computational tasks,
with the Internet serving as part of the networking substrate for
the devices (``Things'') to exchange information.
In its current realization today, the \acrlong{IoT} comprises
devices in cars, homes and other buildings, public transport,
industrial installations, medical contexts, and farming.
This enables remote control and supervision of systems, provides
means of data collection for evaluation, aids
task automation, and advances convergence of cyber-physical systems.

However, the larger-scale usefulness of current \acrlong{IoT}
systems is held back by design choices of system vendors to
integrate all of the functionality (from sensing and recording
to data exchange and analysis) into monolithic silos of services.
This design not only grants the vendor exclusive access to the
sensor data, but also allows them to exert control over the ways
that devices are used and operated. For example, a firmware update
may disable device functionality (\albert{ref}), or services could
require paid-for subscriptions for the device to work
(\albert{ref}).
If the device owner does not comply, their ability of using
the device might be hampered. Furthermore, the owner has little
choice over which type of device they interlink with what service
provider.

Besides causing inefficiency and loss of control for the end user,
these issues also present substantial hurdles for the progress
of scientific research on distributed sensor devices.
The inability of accessing sensor data precludes using the
data for novel applications; fragmentation and per-vendor silos
prohibit studying cooperative use cases.

Therefore, this proposal suggests to re-think the design choices
that made the current acrlong{IoT} landscape a heap of segregated
monoliths, and instead make it an an open system with proper interfaces and people in control to enable cooperative sensing, crowdery, etc.


\subsection{CISE Research Focus}
\explain{This section describes the research focus that is enabled by the 
infrastructure, the importance of the research problems to advancing 
CISE research frontiers, and the expertise of the research team relative 
to the focused research thrust. The description should identify the 
project team and detail each memberâ€™s contributions to the project as 
well as specific expertise relative to the proposed focused research 
agenda.}


\subsection{Sample research project}
\explain{A short (2-3 sentences) summary of one potential research project 
should be included.}

\subsection{Nature of the community involvement}
\explain{(required for CI-P, CI-New, CI-EN, or CI-SUSTAIN projects). This 
section demonstrates the community involvement in the creation, 
enhancement, evaluation, and use of the resource. Describe the research 
community involved in the project. CI-New projects should show the 
community involvement and demand for the project as well as indicate 
the community commitment to establishing and using the infrastructure. 
CI-EN and CI-SUSTAIN projects should describe community usage of the 
infrastructure as well as community involvement in enhancement and 
sustainment efforts.}


\subsection{Relevance to CISE}
\explain{
This section should include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A list of specific CISE researchers who are involved in the leadership of the project and in the development of the infrastructure (including any enhancement or sustainment plan, as appropriate);
  \item A list of the CISE researchers communities that will benefit from the infrastructure; and
  \item A list of any prior CISE funding the infrastructure has received (enhancement projects should also include the approximate date when the infrastructure involved was established).
\end{itemize}
