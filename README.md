# Project Summary (1 page max)

Overview, statement on intellectual merit of the proposed activity, 
and statement on broader impacts of the proposed activity.

The overview includes a description of the activity that would result 
if the proposal were funded and a statement of objectives and methods 
to be employed. The statement on intellectual merit should describe the 
potential of the proposed activity to advance knowledge. The statement 
on broader impacts should describe the potential of the proposed 
activity to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of 
specific, desired societal outcomes.

The Project Summary should be written in the third person, informative 
to other persons working in the same or related fields, and, insofar as 
possible, understandable to a scientifically or technically literate 
lay reader. It should not be an abstract of the proposal.

The Project Summary may ONLY be uploaded as a Supplementary Document if 
use of special characters is necessary. Such Project Summaries must be 
formatted with **separate headings for Overview, Intellectual Merit and 
Broader Impacts**. Failure to include these headings will result in the 
proposal being returned without review.

Also, provide 3-5 high-level keyword descriptors for the project at the
end of the overview in the Project Summary. Include descriptors of the
CISE core discipline(s) that is (are) most closely related to the 
intellectual focus of the research that the infrastructure will enable. 
You may also include a basic descriptor of the type of infrastructure. 
CISE personnel will use this information in implementing the merit 
review process. Keywords should be prefaced with "Keywords" followed by 
a colon and each keyword should be separated by semi-colons.

# Project Description (15 pages max)

* Proposed CISE research infrastructure and its estimated lifetime, 
noting whether it is new infrastructure to be created and operated or 
existing infrastructure to be enhanced and operated;
* Compelling new CISE research opportunities enabled by the proposed 
infrastructure (including a description of the steps taken to identify 
the research opportunities enabled by the infrastructure as well as 
evidence that a diverse community of users plan to use the capabilities 
provided);
* CISE sub-disciplines that will benefit from the infrastructure and 
CISE-centric research groups within the participating institutions that 
will use the infrastructure;
* Existing related resources along with a justification that the 
proposed research cannot be accomplished with these resources at the 
institution or elsewhere;
* Samples of focused research projects or agendas that the 
infrastructure will enable (note that the novelty and innovative 
aspects of the research must be evident along with clear evidence that 
the proposed infrastructure is essential to moving CISE research 
frontiers forward);
* Quality of service commitment to the relevant CISE research 
community;
* Means by which user satisfaction will be evaluated and used to 
refine and improve subsequent infrastructure operations;
* Plans for outreach to ensure that a broad community of users is 
engaged;
* Community plans to provide long-term sustainability of the 
infrastructure;
* Qualifications of the PIs and the project team to manage the 
creation or enhancement and operations of the research infrastructure 
in support of its users; and
* Detailed project management plan, including a timeline, that 
outlines all steps to be undertaken to acquire, develop, and/or operate 
the research infrastructure, and identify the parties responsible for 
each major task.

If the proposed infrastructure is related to previously NSF-funded 
infrastructure, describe the extent to which the previously funded 
infrastructure will be integrated with the new infrastructure. Describe 
how funds remaining from earlier NSF grants for related infrastructure 
will be integrated with the requested award.

(i) Content

The Project Description should provide a clear statement of the work to 
be undertaken and must include the objectives for the period of the 
proposed work and expected significance; the relationship of this work 
to the present state of knowledge in the field, as well as to work in 
progress by the PI under other support.

The Project Description should outline the general plan of work, 
including the broad design of activities to be undertaken, and, where 
appropriate, provide a clear description of experimental methods and 
procedures. Proposers should address what they want to do, why they 
want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they 
succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. 
The project activities may be based on previously established and/or 
innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well 
justified. These issues apply to both the technical aspects of the 
proposal and the way in which the project may make broader 
contributions.

The Project Description must contain, as a separate section within the 
narrative, a section labeled "Broader Impacts". This section should 
provide a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities. 
Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, 
through the activities that are directly related to specific research 
projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are 
complementary to the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific 
knowledge and activities that contribute to the achievement of 
societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not 
limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and 
underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at 
any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement 
with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in 
society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; 
increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved 
national security; increased economic competitiveness of the US; and 
enhanced infrastructure for research and education.

Plans for data management and sharing of the products of research, 
including preservation, documentation, and sharing of data, samples, 
physical collections, curriculum materials and other related research 
and education products should be described in the Special Information 
and Supplementary Documentation section of the proposal (see GPG 
Chapter II.C.2.j for additional instructions for preparation of this 
section).

(ii) Page Limitations and Inclusion of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) 
within the Project Description

Brevity will assist reviewers and Foundation staff in dealing 
effectively with proposals. Therefore, the Project Description 
(including Results from Prior NSF Support, which is limited to five 
pages) may not exceed 15 pages. Visual materials, including charts, 
graphs, maps, photographs and other pictorial presentations are 
included in the 15-page limitation. PIs are cautioned that the Project 
Description must be self-contained and that URLs must not be used 
because: 1) the information could circumvent page limitations; 2) the 
reviewers are under no obligation to view the sites; and 3) the sites 
could be altered or deleted between the time of submission and the time 
of review.

Conformance to the 15-page limit will be strictly enforced and may not 
be exceeded unless a deviation has been specifically authorized. (GPG 
Chapter II.A contains information on deviations.)

(iii) Results from Prior NSF Support

If any PI or co-PI identified on the proposal has received NSF funding 
with a start date in the past five years (including any current 
funding and no cost extensions), information on the award is required 
for each PI and co-PI, regardless of whether the support was directly 
related to the proposal or not. In cases where the PI or co-PI has 
received more than one award (excluding amendments to existing awards), 
they need only report on the one award most closely related to the 
proposal. Funding includes not just salary support, but any funding 
awarded by NSF. NSF awards such as standard or continuing grants, 
Graduate Research Fellowship, Major Research Instrumentation, travel, 
conference, and center awards, etc., are subject to this requirement.

The following information must be provided:

(a) the NSF award number, amount and period of support;

(b) the title of the project;

(c) a summary of the results of the completed work, including 
accomplishments, supported by the award. The results must be separately 
described under two distinct headings, Intellectual Merit and Broader 
Impacts;

(d) a listing of the publications resulting from the NSF award (a 
complete bibliographic citation for each publication must be provided 
either in this section or in the References Cited section of the 
proposal); if none, state "No publications were produced under this 
award."

(e) evidence of research products and their availability, including, 
but not limited to: data, publications, samples, physical collections, 
software, and models, as described in any Data Management Plan; and

(f) if the proposal is for renewed support, a description of the 
relation of the completed work to the proposed work.

Reviewers will be asked to comment on the quality of the prior work 
described in this section of the proposal. Note that the proposal may 
contain **up to five pages to describe the results**. Results may be 
summarized in fewer than five pages, which would give the balance of 
the 15 pages for the Project Description.

(iv) Unfunded Collaborations

Any substantial collaboration with individuals not included in the 
budget should be described in the Facilities, Equipment and Other 
Resources section of the proposal (see GPG Chapter II.C.2.i) and 
documented in a letter of collaboration from each collaborator. Such 
letters should be provided in the supplementary documentation section 
of the FastLane Proposal Preparation Module and follow the format 
instructions specified in GPG Chapter II.C.2.j. Collaborative 
activities that are identified in the budget should follow the 
instructions in GPG Chapter II.D.

(v) Group Proposals

NSF encourages submission of proposals by groups of investigators; 
often these are submitted to carry out interdisciplinary projects. 
Unless stipulated in a specific program solicitation, however, such 
proposals will be subject to the 15-page Project Description limitation 
established in Section (ii) above. PIs who wish to exceed the 
established page limitations for the Project Description must request 
and receive a deviation in advance of proposal submission. (GPG Chapter 
II.A contains information on deviations.)

~~(vi) Proposals for Renewed Support~~ (not applicable)


# References Cited

Reference information is required. Each reference must include the 
names of all authors (in the same sequence in which they appear in the 
publication), the article and journal title, book title, volume number, 
page numbers, and year of publication. (See also GPG Chapter 
II.C.2.d.(iii)(d)) If the proposer has a website address readily 
available, that information should be included in the citation. It is 
not NSF's intent, however, to place an undue burden on proposers to 
search for the URL of every referenced publication. Therefore, 
inclusion of a website address is optional. A proposal that includes 
reference citation(s) that do not specify a URL is not considered to be 
in violation of NSF proposal preparation guidelines and the proposal 
will still be reviewed.

Proposers must be especially careful to follow accepted scholarly 
practices in providing citations for source materials relied upon when 
preparing any section of the proposal. While there is no established 
page limitation for the references, this section must include 
bibliographic citations only and must not be used to provide 
parenthetical information outside of the 15-page Project Description.

# Current and Pending Support

This section of the proposal calls for required information on
all current and pending support for ongoing projects and proposals,
including this project (...)


# Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources

This section of the proposal is used to assess the adequacy of the 
resources available to perform the effort proposed to satisfy both the 
Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts review criteria. Proposers 
should describe only those resources that are directly applicable. 
Proposers should include an aggregated description of the internal and 
external resources (both physical and personnel) that the organization 
and its collaborators will provide to the project, should it be funded. 
Such information must be provided in this section, in lieu of other 
parts of the proposal (e.g., budget justification, project 
description). The description should be narrative in nature and must 
not include any quantifiable financial information. Reviewers will 
evaluate the information during the merit review process and the 
cognizant NSF Program Officer will review it for programmatic and 
technical sufficiency.

Although these resources are not considered cost sharing as defined in 
2 CFR § 200.306, the Foundation does expect that the resources 
identified in the Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources section 
will be provided, or made available, should the proposal be funded. AAG 
Chapter II.B.1 specifies procedures for use by the awardee when there 
are postaward changes to objectives, scope or methods/procedures.
