# Project Summary (1 page max)

Overview, statement on intellectual merit of the proposed activity, 
and statement on broader impacts of the proposed activity.

The overview includes a description of the activity that would result 
if the proposal were funded and a statement of objectives and methods 
to be employed. The statement on intellectual merit should describe the 
potential of the proposed activity to advance knowledge. The statement 
on broader impacts should describe the potential of the proposed 
activity to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of 
specific, desired societal outcomes.

The Project Summary should be written in the third person, informative 
to other persons working in the same or related fields, and, insofar as 
possible, understandable to a scientifically or technically literate 
lay reader. It should not be an abstract of the proposal.

The Project Summary may ONLY be uploaded as a Supplementary Document if 
use of special characters is necessary. Such Project Summaries must be 
formatted with **separate headings for Overview, Intellectual Merit and 
Broader Impacts**. Failure to include these headings will result in the 
proposal being returned without review.
